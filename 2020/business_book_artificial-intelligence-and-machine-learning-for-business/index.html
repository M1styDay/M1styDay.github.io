<h2 id="2what-are-machine-learning-and-artificial-inteligence">2.What are Machine Learning and Artificial Inteligence?</h2>
<h3 id="ml-definition">ML-Definition</h3>
<p>Machine learning is the use of mathematical procedures (algorithms)to analyze data. The aim is to discover useful patterns (relationships or correlations)between different items of data. Once the relationships have been identified, these can be used to make inferences about the behavior of new cases when they present themselves.</p>
<h3 id="applications">Applications</h3>
<ul>
<li>Object recognition
<ul>
<li>One application of machine leatning is obiect recognition. The goal is to develop systems that can identify everyday objects from images the systemn is presented with. The data used to develop an obiect recognition system consists of pictures of different obiects such as chairs, umbrellas, washing machines and so on .Each picture presented to the machine learning algorithm is labeled to identify which type of object it contains.</li>
<li>By analyzing the different images, machine learning algorithms recognize that certain obiects are associated with certain features(patterns).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prediction
<ul>
<li>One of the most common, and arguably the first, application of machine learning is prediction. It’s about using machine learning to determine something that you don’t currently know, based on the information that you currently have available. The patterns that one finds relate to the relationships between behaviors and outcomes. Very  often  this  relates  to  people’s  past  behavior  and  what  they subsequently went on to do. Having identified the relationships that exist, it is then possible to make predictions about someone’s future behavior  based  on  their  current  state  of  being.  If  you  give  me  a sample of peoples’ previous purchasing history, I can utilize machine learning to identify patterns in their purchase behavior. I can then use these patterns to  predict what goods someone is likely to buy next; i.e. future purchases are the outcome that I want to predict. This allows me to target them with tailored promotional offers for those specific products.</li>
<li>Using machine learning for prediction is sometimes referred to as predictive modelling or <strong>Predictive Analytics</strong> (PA) . In fact , predictive analytics 1s such a common application of machine learning that many people (rightly or wrongly) often use the two terms interchangeably.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reducing uncertainty
<ul>
<li>Another way to think about machine learning / predictive analytics is as a method of reducing uncertainty. There are a whole host of possible outcomes that could occur in any given situation Machine learning won&rsquo;t tell you with absolute certainty which outcome will occur , but it can provide some insight into the likelihood or odds . of each outcome.</li>
<li>A predictive model ( or just model going forward ) is the output generated by the machine learning process . The model captures the relationships ( patterns ) that have been uncovered by the analytics process . Once a model has been created , it can be used to generate new predictions . Organizations then use the model&rsquo;s predictions to decide what to do or how to treat people . So , machine learning is brocess and a predictive model is the end product of that process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="situations-and-problem">Situations and Problem</h3>
<ul>
<li>credit scoring
<ul>
<li>One very well-known application of machine learning is credit scoring . When someone wants a loan , credit card or mortgage the lender asks the individual questions about themselves and their lifestyle . They then combine this with information from a credit report containing details about the individual&rsquo;s previous borrowing history , provided by a credit reference agency such as Experian or Equifax. The information is then fed into a predictive model to generate a credit score.</li>
<li>If you live in the USA you will probably be familiar with FICO and / or Vantage scores . A high score 750 ) is a prediction that someone is very likely to repay any money they borrow ; i.e. that they are creditworthy . A low score ( &lt; 500 ) indicates that someone is very uncreditworthy . Banks and finance companies the world over use similar credit scoring methods.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>target marketing
<ul>
<li>Another common application of machine learning is target marketing , Given information about someone&rsquo;s age , gender , income web-browsing , purchase history , location and so on , a marketing department can predict if the person is interested in a particular product or not . They then use that prediction to decide whether or not to target them with promotional offers . Likewise , predictive models can also be used to infer how much people are willing to pay for products like insurance . This information is then used to tailor a personalized pricing strategy to each person&rsquo;s individual circumstances.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>preventative health care
<ul>
<li>A further example of machine learning in action is preventative health care . Traditional health care systems are reactive . Peopl de seek medical assistance when they feel ill . Doctors then do their best to reat the illnesses they are presented with-treatments that can be very costly and time consuming . These days , advanced health care systems are increasingly focusing their attention on prevention rather than cure . This vastly reduces costs and improves patient outcomes . Machine learning is used to assess peoples medical records and predict the likelihood of the them developing specifc conditions such as heart disease or diabetes. often vears in advance Individuals who come at the top of the pile ; i.e. those that the model predicts are most likely to get the disease , are contacted with a view of initiating preventative action . For example , making lifestyle changes of taking preventative medication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Recommend
<ul>
<li>A final example of machine learning in action is determining what type of news ( and other ) articles to recommend to people . Social media providers use machine learning to analyze what articles you ve read in the past and the type of topics you discuss with friends then drives the content that they promote to you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="ai-definition">AI-Definition</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are many and varied definitions of what A is , and as with predictive analytics , many people use the terms AI and machine learning interchangeably . In terms of the overall scope of AI research , machine learning is a key field of study , but there are many others . True artificial intelligence is about muc much more than just pattern recognition and prediction . Some experts also question if true AI can ever be achieved by just following a Brute force approach of developing ever more complex algorithms using ever more powerful computer hardware Is there some additional ( as yet unknown ) element required for human-like intelligence and self-awareness which cant be replicated ia computation alone ?</li>
<li>So in one sense its incorrect to say that machine learning an artificial intelligence are the same thing . However , in practice almost every AI system in use today relies heavily on machine learning
Therefore , for the purposes of this book a simple working definition of AI that we shall adhere to it:</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Artificial Intelligence ( AI ) is the replication of human analytical and / or decision-making capabilities</strong></p>
<h3 id="narrow-ai-and-general-ai">Narrow AI and General AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>All of the A applications in use today are what the industry refers to as <strong>Narrow AI</strong> . They are very good at behaving intelligently wher applied to one well defined area of expertise . However , these systems are miles away from <strong>General AI</strong> .</li>
<li>General AI is a system that can learn and act intelligently across a wide range of environments and problems in a similar way to a person . An AI application that is used to detect tax avoidance for example , is useless at detecting the signs of cancer from medical scans . However a erson could learn to do both these tasks if they were given suitable raining . In a similar vein , a system such as Google Translate is great at understanding the spoken word but wouldn&rsquo;t be much use when it comes to assessing if someone on a dating site might be compatible with you.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-core-components">the Core Components</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data put</li>
<li>Data preprocessing</li>
<li>Predictive models</li>
<li>Decision rules(rule sets)</li>
<li>Response/output</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-and-rule-making">Artificial intelligence and rule making</h3>
<ul>
<li>算法生成规则</li>
<li>人工制定规则</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pattern-recognition">Pattern recognition</h3>
<ul>
<li>The vast majority of AI applications rely heavily on prediction driven by pattern recognition ( i.e. machine learning / predictive analytics ) . Take speech recognition systems that support tools such as Apples Siri and Amazon&rsquo;s Echo . Upon hearing a sound , a speech recognition system pre-processes that sound into a number of standardized soundbites . It will then try to identify what word it thinks has been spoken . This is based on a set of probabilities (scores) generated by a predictive model created using machine learning . If the system calculates that there is a 5 % o chance that the sound is &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; 20% that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Jell-O&rdquo; and 75% that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;Mellow&rdquo; then it will make an educated guess that the word spoken was “Mellow”.</li>
<li>Advanced AI systems use layers of complex predictive models in combination to formulate a view as to what is going on around them given the inputs that they receive . The next layer of the speecl recognition system will consider phrases and word structure . The predictive elements of the system are then combined with decision rules ( decision logic ) to determine what actions to take when certain words or phrases are spoKen .</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="three-changes">Three changes</h3>
<ul>
<li>terminology
<ul>
<li>In the 1980s / 1990s what is now termed machine learning / AI came under the title of Data Mining or computational statistics . Its also the case that the theory underpinning the most common machine learning approaches in use today were developed before or during the 1990s (although many have been refined and extended since then).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>computer hardware and software
<ul>
<li>The second thing that has changed is the computer hardware an software that underpin machine learning.The shift to placing services online via smartphones. tablets and the internet means that there is now so much more information available about people than ever before . and the amount of information continues to grow vear on year . The speed and storage capabilities of computers has also increased considerably . This makes it possible to process huge amounts of data quickly and cost effectively . Likewise , the complexity of machine learning algorithms and the predictive models they generate has increased by many orders of magnitude in just a tew years.</li>
<li>In parallel with the advances in hardware and algorithm design there are now a whole host of software tools availlable for machine learning . Much of it free and / or open source ( such as the R and Python programming languages ) and available via one&rsquo;s PC , laptop or cloud services offered by the IT giants such as Microsofto and google</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the way that we interact with the underlying models and decision rules
<ul>
<li>We no longer have to type very rigld instructions on keyboards of have to interpret pages of detailed mathematical output . Instead , modern A systems interact with us in much more human-like ways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-interfaces-between-humans-and-computers">the interfaces between humans and computers</h3>
<ul>
<li>Often the interfaces between humans and computers are themselves based on machine learning principles , driven by predictive models .</li>
<li>If we return to the whisky sales example , I could use machine learning in the design of a chatbot to talk to people on social media about their drinking habits . The data gathered by the chatbot then supplements other data that Ive gathered about people . If the whisky application determines that people should be given a discount offer , then this could be relayed back to customers via the chatbot in a conversational form . rather than the more traditional approach of sending them a coupon or discount code via text or e-mail.</li>
<li>The same principle applies to digital personal assistants such as Amazons Echo . One set of algorithms are used to translate what you say into soundbites ( data pre-processing ) . The pre-processed soundbites are then fed into another set of predictive models which to predict what outcome you are asking for ; such as playing a certain song or asking about the weather . Amazon allows developers to use this pre-processing capability for freell-allowing anyone to incorporate advanced speech recognition into their programs and apps.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-cost-of-entry-into-the-world-of-machine-learning-and-ai-has-reduced-considerably">the cost of entry into the world of machine learning and AI has reduced considerably</h3>
<ul>
<li>What all this means is that the cost of entry into the world of machine learning and AI has reduced considerably . Only a few years ago machine learning was primarily the domain of large businesses and academic institutions . Today , anyone with a laptop and some time on their hands can get involved and start building predictive models relatively quickly and at almost zero cost , and then develop an advanced user interface to implement those models as an AI app.</li>
<li>These days . there are even competition websites for machine learning such as Kaggle, Organizations provide their data for free , and then amateur and professional teams compete to see who can build the model with the greatest predictive power using the data that has been provided .</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="data-science-and-data-scientist">data science and data scientist</h3>
<ul>
<li>Data science isn&rsquo;t a science in the same way that physics chemistry or biology are . It&rsquo;s simply a description of the application of machine learning techniques .</li>
<li>Likewise , a data scientist is someone who can apply machine leamning in a practical way . Its about more than just the mathematical aspects of the subject .</li>
<li>A good data scientist also has an understanding of data and IT systems and is able to understand the business context in which their solutions will be applied.</li>
