      <description>Lecture 2：Exploring and Visualizing Data   This lecture focuses on how we can use descriptive statistics and exploratory analysis to understand datasets. A primary goal of data visualization is to help identify patterns in data and be able to communicate these patterns succinctly to an analyst. Often our goal is to find patterns in large datasets, to help reduce the size of the dataset we introduce cluster analysis as a data mining technique for grouping objects into similar subsets or clusters.</description>

      <description>Lecture 1: Understanding Data and the Data Mining Process   In this class we discuss the role of data mining for electronic commerce. The wealth of information and methodologies does not necessarily lead managers to make better decisions unless they are able to transform the data into a useable form. In this lecture we consider how data mining can help turn data into information that managers. We also consider examples where data mining has been used successfully in business and electronic commerce.</description>

      <description>k-cores and Densest Subgraphs Graph  Graph Mining: finding dense regions ina graph (for community detectionm spam detection, event detection&amp;hellip;)  Definitions   Undirected Graph: A graph G is a pair ($V_G$,$E_G$), where $V_G$ is a set of nodes, while $E_G$ is a set of edges (u,v) with u,v ∈ $V_G$.
  Other important definitions:
 A graph H = ($V_H$,$E_H$) is a (induced) subgraph of G = ($V_G$,$E_G$) if the following two conditions hold: $V_H$ ⊆ $V_G$, moreover, (u,v) ∈ $E_H$ if and only if u,v ∈ H and (u,v) ∈ $E_G$.</description>

      <description>Community Detection Community Detection Introduction  Community detection is the problem of finding groups of entities in a network, so as to reflect the structure of the network and other meaningful properties of the underlying system. Examples of communities are: computer scientists, users in Facebook sharing similar interests, blogs dealing with the same topic, group of dolphins interacting between each other, etc. Community detection finds application in social science, advertising, and it is a cool problem!</description>

      <description>Model Evaluation  Metrics for Performance Evaluation  How to evaluate the performance of a model?   Methods for Performance Evaluation  How to obtain reliable estimates?   Methods for Model Comparison  How to compare the relative performance among competing models?    Metrics for Performance Evaluation Confusion Matrix  Focus on the predictive capability of a model  Rather than running time, scalability, etc.   Confusion Matrix:   Most widely-used metric:  Limitation of Accuracy  Consider a 2-Class problem  Number of Class 1 examples = 10 Number of Class 0 examples = 9990   If model predicts everything to be Class 0, accuracy is 9990/10000 = 99.</description>

      <description>KNN K-Nearest Neighbor Classifier  Training:  turn dataset into vectors (e.g. points euclidean space) load them into main memory   Prediction  find the k nearest points output majority class in those points   Requires  distance function a value of k   Distance functions: Euclidean distance but also cosine similarity Prediction: other strategies are possible (e.g. weighted vote according to the distances).  Nearest Neighbor Classification  Choosing the value of k:  If k is too small, sensitive to noise points If k is too large, neighborhood may include points from other classes   Attributes may have to be scaled to prevent distance measures from being dominated by one of the attributes  height of a person may vary from 1.</description>

      <description>Decisision Trees Classification Definition  Given a collection of records (training set)  Each record contains a set of attributes, one of the attributes is the Class.   Find a model for Class attribute as a function of the values of other attributes Goal: previously unseen records should be assigned a Class as accurately as possible  A test set is used to determine the accuracy of the model. Usually, the given data set is divided into training and test sets, with training set used to build the model and test set used to validate it.</description>

      <description>The Theory behind PageRank Computing Importance  Web graph: a directed graph G = (V , E ) where nodes represent web pages, while there is a directed edge between u and v if there is a hyperlink between the corresponding web pages. Importance of v is proportional to the importance of nodes linking to v. It can be modeled by a system of linear equations&amp;hellip;  System of Linear Equations for PageRank PageRank  The importance of a web page can be computed by solving the corresponding system of linear equations.</description>

      <description>TA &amp;amp; NRA Qustion A website posts information about apartments. Suppose that there are 10 apartments to be sold, together with their ratings($a_1$) and prices($a_2$), as listed in the table below. The website employs an aggregation function f = 0.6*$a_1$+ 0.4*$a_2$ to rank these apartments.
Q1) Write down two lists of apartments, in descending order of $a_1$ and $a_2$.
Q2) Use the TA algorithm to find the two best apartments in terms of f.</description>

      <description>Threshold Algorithm (TA)  Original version, often used as synonym for entire family of top-k algorithms. But: eager random access to candidate objects required. Worst-case memory consumption is strictly bounded → O(k)  No-Random-Access Algorithm (NRA)  No random access required at all, but may have to scan large parts of the index lists. Worst-case memory consumption bounded by index size → O(m*n + k)  </description>

The points in P can only be located on the vertices or edges of G. Each point of interest is with some labels (at least one), e.g., &amp;lsquo;school&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;hotel&amp;rsquo;, &amp;lsquo;restaurant&amp;rsquo;. The points P are indexed by an R-tree $R_P$ based on location and by an inverted file (see the demo below) IP based on the labels.</description>

      <description>Shortest Path Search Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm   Dijkstra算法用来寻找图形中节点之间的最短路径。
  在Dijkstra算法中，需要计算每一个节点距离起点的总移动代价。同时，还需要一个优先队列结构。对于所有待遍历的节点，放入优先队列中会按照代价进行排序。
  在算法运行的过程中，每次都从优先队列中选出代价最小的作为下一个遍历的节点。直到到达终点为止。
  A* algorithm   A*算法通过下面这个函数来计算每个节点的优先级:
 f(n)=g(n)+h(n)  f(n)是节点n的综合优先级。当我们选择下一个要遍历的节点时，我们总会选取综合优先级最高（值最小）的节点。 g(n) 是节点n距离起点的代价。 h(n)是节点n距离终点的预计代价，这也就是A*算法的启发函数。      A*算法在运算过程中，每次从优先队列中选取f(n)值最小（优先级最高）的节点作为下一个待遍历的节点。
  另外，A*算法使用两个集合来表示待遍历的节点，与已经遍历过的节点，这通常称之为open_set和close_set。
   在极端情况下，当启发函数h(n)始终为0，则将由g(n)决定节点的优先级，此时算法就退化成了Dijkstra算法。 如果h(n)始终小于等于节点n到终点的代价，则A*算法保证一定能够找到最短路径。但是当h(n)的值越小，算法将遍历越多的节点，也就导致算法越慢。 如果h(n)完全等于节点n到终点的代价，则A*算法将找到最佳路径，并且速度很快。可惜的是，并非所有场景下都能做到这一点。因为在没有达到终点之前，我们很难确切算出距离终点还有多远。 如果h(n)的值比节点n到终点的代价要大，则A*算法不能保证找到最短路径，不过此时会很快。 在另外一个极端情况下，如果h(n)相较于g(n)大很多，则此时只有h(n)产生效果，这也就变成了最佳优先搜索。  Bi-directional search Spatial queries over spatial networks  Data:  A (static) spatial network (e.g., city map) A (dynamic) set of spatial objects   Spatial queries based on network distance:  Selections.</description>

  A large set of baskets, each of which is a small set of the items, e.g., the things one customer buys on one day.
  A general many-many mapping (association) between two kinds of things.

      <description>Improvements to A-Priori PCY Algorithm Introdution  Main observation: during pass 1 of A-priori, most memory is idle. Use that memory to keep additional info to improve storage during pass 2 of A-priori. Passes &amp;gt; 2 are the same as in A-Priori.  Pass 1  Use a hash function which &amp;ldquo;bucketizes&amp;rdquo; item pairs, that is, maps them to integers in $[1,k]$. Each &amp;ldquo;bucket&amp;rdquo; i in $[1,k]$ is associated with a counter $c_i$.</description>
