      <description>Decisision Trees Classification Definition  Given a collection of records (training set)  Each record contains a set of attributes, one of the attributes is the Class.   Find a model for Class attribute as a function of the values of other attributes Goal: previously unseen records should be assigned a Class as accurately as possible  A test set is used to determine the accuracy of the model. Usually, the given data set is divided into training and test sets, with training set used to build the model and test set used to validate it.</description>

      <description>The Theory behind PageRank Computing Importance  Web graph: a directed graph G = (V , E ) where nodes represent web pages, while there is a directed edge between u and v if there is a hyperlink between the corresponding web pages. Importance of v is proportional to the importance of nodes linking to v. It can be modeled by a system of linear equations&amp;hellip;  System of Linear Equations for PageRank PageRank  The importance of a web page can be computed by solving the corresponding system of linear equations.</description>

Suppose that there are 10 apartments to be sold, together with their ratings($a_1$) and prices($a_2$), as listed in the table below. The website employs an aggregation function f = 0.6*$a_1$+ 0.4*$a_2$ to rank these apartments.
Q1) Write down two lists of apartments, in descending order of $a_1$ and $a_2$.
Q2) Use the TA algorithm to find the two best apartments in terms of f.</description>

Use that memory to keep additional info to improve storage during pass 2 of A-priori. Passes &amp;gt; 2 are the same as in A-Priori.  Pass 1  Use a hash function which &amp;ldquo;bucketizes&amp;rdquo; item pairs, that is, maps them to integers in $[1,k]$. Each &amp;ldquo;bucket&amp;rdquo; i in $[1,k]$ is associated with a counter $c_i$.</description>

SON Algorithm Introduction Let s be the support threshold:
 Pass 1:  Divide the dataset into k chunks, let $p_i$ be such that the ith chunk contains a fraction of pi of the input dataset.</description>

      <description>Association Frequent Itemsets Qustion 1 Qustion 1-1  Table 1 shows a list of baskets as well as the items they contain. For example, this could be the set of products bought by each customer during a single trip to a grocery store. Using the A-priori algorithm, find all frequent itemsets with support threshold 0.4 (i.e. in this example they occur at least 40% of 7 times, i.e. at least three times.</description>
