      <description>The Theory behind PageRank Computing Importance  Web graph: a directed graph G = (V , E ) where nodes represent web pages, while there is a directed edge between u and v if there is a hyperlink between the corresponding web pages. Importance of v is proportional to the importance of nodes linking to v. It can be modeled by a system of linear equations&amp;hellip;  System of Linear Equations for PageRank PageRank  The importance of a web page can be computed by solving the corresponding system of linear equations.</description>

      <description>Shortest Path Search Dijkstra&amp;rsquo;s algorithm   Dijkstra算法用来寻找图形中节点之间的最短路径。
  在Dijkstra算法中，需要计算每一个节点距离起点的总移动代价。同时，还需要一个优先队列结构。对于所有待遍历的节点，放入优先队列中会按照代价进行排序。
  在算法运行的过程中，每次都从优先队列中选出代价最小的作为下一个遍历的节点。直到到达终点为止。
  A* algorithm   A*算法通过下面这个函数来计算每个节点的优先级:
 f(n)=g(n)+h(n)  f(n)是节点n的综合优先级。当我们选择下一个要遍历的节点时，我们总会选取综合优先级最高（值最小）的节点。 g(n) 是节点n距离起点的代价。 h(n)是节点n距离终点的预计代价，这也就是A*算法的启发函数。      A*算法在运算过程中，每次从优先队列中选取f(n)值最小（优先级最高）的节点作为下一个待遍历的节点。
  另外，A*算法使用两个集合来表示待遍历的节点，与已经遍历过的节点，这通常称之为open_set和close_set。
   在极端情况下，当启发函数h(n)始终为0，则将由g(n)决定节点的优先级，此时算法就退化成了Dijkstra算法。 如果h(n)始终小于等于节点n到终点的代价，则A*算法保证一定能够找到最短路径。但是当h(n)的值越小，算法将遍历越多的节点，也就导致算法越慢。 如果h(n)完全等于节点n到终点的代价，则A*算法将找到最佳路径，并且速度很快。可惜的是，并非所有场景下都能做到这一点。因为在没有达到终点之前，我们很难确切算出距离终点还有多远。 如果h(n)的值比节点n到终点的代价要大，则A*算法不能保证找到最短路径，不过此时会很快。 在另外一个极端情况下，如果h(n)相较于g(n)大很多，则此时只有h(n)产生效果，这也就变成了最佳优先搜索。  Bi-directional search Spatial queries over spatial networks  Data:  A (static) spatial network (e.g., city map) A (dynamic) set of spatial objects   Spatial queries based on network distance:  Selections.</description>

Use that memory to keep additional info to improve storage during pass 2 of A-priori. Passes &amp;gt; 2 are the same as in A-Priori.  Pass 1  Use a hash function which &amp;ldquo;bucketizes&amp;rdquo; item pairs, that is, maps them to integers in $[1,k]$. Each &amp;ldquo;bucket&amp;rdquo; i in $[1,k]$ is associated with a counter $c_i$.</description>
