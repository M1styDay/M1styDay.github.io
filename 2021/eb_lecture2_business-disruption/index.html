<h2 id="how-to-plan-e-business-initiatives-in-established-companies">How to Plan E-Business Initiatives in Established Companies</h2>
<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Over the past decade, Internet and Web technologies have remade the business world. E-business has dramatically changed how companies’ business processes are implemented and enhanced, altered industry structures, and shifted the balance of power between corporations and their suppliers and customers (both downstream partners and consumers).</p>
<p>Companies in every industry have had to evaluate the opportunities and threats presented by e-business. Although many “pure-play” or “born-on-the-Web” organizations have come into being, the economy still consists mostly of companies that were created
well before the advent of e-business. For large and mature corporations, responding to these trends has been difficult. Even so, most e-business research has focused on new companies. From our academic research and work with various established, global corporations, we have developed a planning process that puts e-business into perspective and helps make it manageable. (See “About the Research.”)</p>
<h3 id="the-e-business-planning-process">The E-Business Planning Process</h3>
<p>Four major steps make up the planning phase for new e-business projects using existing products and services, processes and markets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Identify potential e-business initiatives</li>
<li>Analyze the functional scope of e-business initiatives</li>
<li>Analyze the sustainability of benefits from e-business initiatives and</li>
<li>Prioritize e-business initiatives</li>
</ol>
<p>In addition to the planning phase, the e-business development process also includes phases for feasibility analysis, implementation, testing, deployment and performance review. The overall process can be set within a development life cycle spanning all these phases. In this article, we focus on the four planning steps, since the later phases are well
supported by established methods for information system development.</p>
<h4 id="adding-value-through-e-business">Adding value through e-business</h4>
<ul>
<li>Customers are a driving force for value creation. (See “The Contexts of E-Business Initiatives.”) Managers can use customer needs to identify opportunities for leveraging e-business to enhance the company’s customer value proposition and to help define specific market segments with distinct priorities. Furthermore, the concerns of distinct functional groups within customer segments may drive different e-business initiatives. For instance, while research and development scientists within a downstream business-to-business customer may value solutions for product development, the customer’s production workers may seek know-how for using the company’s products in making their own products, while the customer’s supply personnel may care primarily about efficient, flexible and responsive order fulfillment and logistics.
<ul>
<li>E-business projects can also create value for internal stakeholders such as employees. E-business can foster knowledge creation and collaboration via dynamic organizational communities. An example is an online forum for improving a corporation’s environmental impact through innovative production and office processes. Through this forum, global teams can collaborate on environmental projects based on common interests and disband once targets are hit.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Cost efficiencies through e-business. As with value creation,
cost savings through e-business can be analyzed using the framework in “The Contexts of E-Business Initiatives.” Yet the cost
perspective is more “inside out” than “outside in.” That is, opportunities for savings are more readily identified for internal business processes and functions, because cost reductions are an area in which the interests of the company may differ from those of its external stakeholders. An important consideration is the potential effect of cost reductions on the value proposition of key stakeholders, such as customers, suppliers, business partners, shareholders and employees. An e-business effort to enable customer selfservice would save money, but it would be inadvisable for key customers with high service expectations. However, customer selfservice could be a very effective method for engaging new and smaller customers over a larger geographical range — customers who might otherwise be inaccessible. (This example also demonstrates how cost-saving initiatives sometimes can be combined with value-adding features to make them more attractive.)</li>
<li>Whether the benefits of e-business lie in value creation or cost savings, the e-business planning process should be part of a corporation’s strategic planning process, not a separate effort. Projects with a customer focus should be based on the relevant competitive strategy (such as cost leadership or differentiation),
while value chain initiatives should be based on the strategy of the relevant business unit(s) with respect to business processes
such as sourcing, technology/product development and staffing.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="analyze-the-functional-scope-of-e-business-initiatives">Analyze the Functional Scope of E-Business Initiatives</h4>
<p>We developed a typology that can be used to plan the functional scope of each e-business proposal for any corporation. (See
“An Architecture of E-Business Processes.”) Functional scope is the set of business processes a company can support for a
particular e-business initiative.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Network services. At a company’s underlying network layer are services and capabilities that form the basis for e-business. These include basic communication services and infrastructure components such as security and reliability. At this level, the opportunities for improvement mostly lie in efficiency and reliability rather than a quest for sustainable competitive differentiation. However, an efficient and effective network infrastructure is often necessary to realize business value through e-business initiatives in three types of processes: trade, decision support and integration processes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Trade processes. These processes support buying and selling online. They can both add value and save costs for business transactions. Specific trade processes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Searching for products, buyers and sellers</li>
<li>Authentication of products, buyers and sellers</li>
<li>Valuation of products</li>
<li>Payment and payment clearance</li>
<li>Logistics such as delivery and installation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decision support processes. These processes enable a company to obtain information and use analytical models that enhance its ability to make effective business decisions. Decision support processes also allow a corporation to interact with other businesses in ways that help all of them make better decisions. Specific decision support processes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Configuration via configurator tools, electronic requirement determination tools and sharable computer-aided design tools</li>
<li>Collaboration with tools such as conferencing, white boarding, electronic brainstorming and shared data repositories</li>
<li>Business intelligence, conducted with analytical tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Integration processes. These processes help corporations integrate their information systems to enable automation of tasks across different component information systems. This includes vertical integration between a company and its suppliers or customers/distributors, and horizontal integration between a business and horizontal partners (for example, by creating integrated catalogs of products or consolidated procurement systems). Specific integration processes include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data integration, allowing a company’s software applications to access its partners’ databases, possibly across heterogeneous and autonomous database structures, software and hardware platforms.</li>
<li>Application integration, involving integration of both data and applications (order, payment, accounting, inventory and work flow systems) through the use of technologies like object-oriented systems and eXtensible Markup Language (mechanisms often described as “Web services”). The role of application integration increases when corporations adopt computer-based systems for internal integration, such as enterprise resource planning systems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>When managers have categorized e-business initiatives according to their functional scope, they can qualitatively identify the potential business value and cost savings. Yet it is not always feasible to quantify e-business efforts — or attain the ideal of monetizing them. Thus, the e-business evaluation process needs to be flexible and adaptive, and not necessarily limited by criteria such as return on investment.</p>
<h5 id="an-architecture-of-e-business-processes">An Architecture of E-Business Processes</h5>
<p>Managers can use this framework to discover which business processes will be needed for any e-business project. The
underlying network layer includes basic communication services and infrastructure components such as security, which in
themselves typically do not add value to e-business initiatives but are requirements for realizing value through the other
types of process. Trade processes support buying and selling online. Decision processes enhance management’s ability to make
decisions. Finally, integration processes enable the automation of tasks between a company and its customers or suppliers.</p>
<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M1styDay/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/20210412154911.png" alt=""></p>
<h4 id="analyze-the-sustainability-of-benefits-from-e-business-initiatives">Analyze the Sustainability of Benefits from E-Business Initiatives</h4>
<p>E-business typically involves the use of software and systems that allow external parties, including competitors, to gain insight into a company’s operations. Thus, innovations involving e-business interactions can be easily emulated and even improved upon by competitors, often at lower cost. This “curse of the bleeding edge” is possible with any innovation but is particularly onerous in the e-business context. For that reason, it is important to assess the sustainability of any competitive advantage that might be derived from an e-business project. For the most part, sustainability is derived from two key factors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Barriers to entry and imitation, including legal restrictions, superior access to inputs or customers, market size and scale economies, and intangible barriers such as historical circumstance.</li>
<li>Early mover advantages, due to learning costs, network externalities, established reputation and buyer uncertainty, and partner switching costs.We look for six features of e-business initiatives to assess their sustainability:
<ul>
<li>Positive network externalities</li>
<li>Proprietary database</li>
<li>Proprietary knowledge base</li>
<li>Proprietary hardware and/or software</li>
<li>Personalization</li>
<li>Exclusive partnerships</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="prioritize-e-business-initiatives">Prioritize E-Business Initiatives</h4>
<p>Since several e-business proposals may well be under consideration at the same time, perhaps by different groups or units within the same organization, executives must be able to choose among them. Traditional cost-benefit analysis can be applied to e-business initiatives and combined with a portfolio planning approach for prioritizing and scheduling projects. In the e-business context, however, it is particularly important to consider the scope of each project and its interdependence with other activities within the corporation. Such interactions can be examined through the lens of information technology architecture. (See “A Layered IT Architecture.”)</p>
<h5 id="a-layered-it-architecture">A Layered IT Architecture</h5>
<p>Information technology architecture is a simple means by which managers can prioritize e-business proposals. These projects often involve components from multiple layers of a company’s IT architecture, and each level depends on elements at lower levels. A new software application might promise great business value, but be infeasible without first implementing required — and expensive — middleware and infrastructure components. The value of an e-business initiative often will depend on existing architectural components, and the incremental benefits of different architectural levels may be hard to separate.</p>

<h3 id="exploring-new-business-opportunities">Exploring New Business Opportunities</h3>
<p>Managers can apply the e-business planning process to a company’s existing products and customers. However, e-business can also create opportunities for completely new products and markets.</p>
<ul>
<li>Adding Information Features</li>
<li>Selling Information As a Product</li>
<li>Selling Knowledge As a Product</li>
<li>Finding New Markets</li>
</ul>

<ul>

<li>Step 2: Analyze the functional scope.</li>
<li>Step 3: Analyze the sustainability of benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="customer-intelligence-initiative">Customer Intelligence Initiative</h4>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: Identify the initiative.</li>
<li>Step 2: Analyze the functional scope.</li>
<li>Step 3: Analyze the sustainability of benefits.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="functional-scope-analyses-for-two-e-business-projects">Functional Scope Analyses for Two E-Business Projects</h4>
<p>To evaluate the resources and skills that would be needed for two e-business proposals at a large and mature packaging company, “An Architecture of E-Business Processes” (p. 31) was converted into a ratings table. The first proposal, for PaKCo (not its real name) to become the leading industry integrator, would require upgraded integration capabilities and better collaboration tools. The second project, to improve PaKCo’s customer intelligence gathering in order to boost sales, would require twice as many e-business improvements as the other project.</p>

<h3 id="the-benefits-of-e-business">THE BENEFITS OF E-BUSINESS</h3>
<p>THE BENEFITS OF E-BUSINESS are not limited to online-only players.Established and mature companies can create significant business value and lower their costs by leveraging e-business through online support for trade, decision support and integration processes. Using our e-business planning process, senior management in established companies can identify attractive e-business initiatives, analyze their functional scope and assess the sustainability of the benefits. Our approach also helps relate e-business initiatives to existing business processes and integrates e-business planning into the broader context of business planning and competitive strategy. At the same time, it helps both business and IT leaders reason more effectively about the relevant scope of ebusiness initiatives, which can range from specialized and targeted
applications to broad infrastructural innovations.</p>

<p>With the broad availability of broadband internet , increasing sophistication of high-definition ( HD ) video technologies and decreasing cost of hard-drive storage , video game console manufacturers saw that their products should no longer be for gaming only . In fact , many players such as Sony and Microsoft had envisioned their game consoles as becoming all encompassing home entertainment centres . Further , given the increasing speed achieved by broadband connections , internet users were increasingly able to access large quantities of data files , especially those containing HD audio and video . Consequently , these console producers developed and offered online libraries as a new service enabling users to download and stream a variety of movies , music and television shows through their consoles.</p>
<p>As top-quality video materials became more easily available through HD broadcasting and nternet downloads , a new recording medium with increased storage capacity was required. Two formats , the Blu-ray format developed by a consortium led by Sony , and the HD-DVD format developed by a consortium led by Toshiba , were engaged in fierce competition in order to become the de facto standard in this area.</p>
<p>By offering online games based on new and existing titles , console makers could provide similar social-networking or virtual-world services to get online gamers to play , connect and form loyal communities . Such communities were expected to help create a perpetual demand for services and products created by the video game makers and their alliance partners . In fact , in-game advertising had already started and offered a new revenue stream to video game developers.</p>
<h3 id="nintendo-innovation-and-the-launch-of-the-wii">Nintendo-Innovation and the Launch of the Wii</h3>
<p>Traditionally , Sony , Microsoft and Nintendo would go into a new cycle or a new battle every five to six years , and in 2000 , Sony&rsquo;s PS2 had emerged as the clear winner . Since then , the focus of the industry had turned even more to the technological advancement of the console hardware , particularly in terms of faster processing speed , higher definition of video quality and increasing complexity of the games . The relentless pursuit of superior technologies became the convention that drove the industry&rsquo;s dynamics.</p>
<p>However , the former leader in the video game industry , Nintendo , adopted a vastly different viewpoint about the future development of the industry . Some years before the battle that began in 2006 , Iwata saw the potential threats facing the industry . He observed that the video game market in Japan was shrinking . Based on various market trends and data , the key cause for this reduction appeared to be the increasing complexity of video games , which required players to invest a significant amount of their time to learn and play these games using increasingly complicated controllers with combinations of buttons and joysticks
Consequently , occasional gamers with busy lives had stopped playing . Further , for novices and non-gamers , the time required to learn and play these games was a big deterrent for potential newcomers to join the camp . Iwata also saw that the video game industry had largely ignored non-gamers and was focused on the existing ones . Armed with these insights , Iwata decided to lead Nintendo down an unorthodox path by devising a radically new strategy.</p>
<p>The objective of this strategy was quite simply to reach out to non-gamers in order to create a bigger market . Iwata&rsquo;s mandate was for simpler games to be developed , targeting all customers , irrespective of age , gender or gaming experience . These new games were to take no more than a few minutes to set up and play . In addition , they would require an easy-to-use controller . He also wanted the game scenarios to be largely based on real-life situations rathe than fantasies.</p>
<p>In order to pilot Iwata&rsquo;s idea . Nintendo first developed a new handheld gaming device called the DS which stood fordouble screen and was launched in 2004 . The DS was positioned as the machine that enriches the owners daily life &quot; . One of the key features of this device was a touch-screen that gamers could tap or write on with a stylus . This innovative design enabled gamers to play without using complicated sets of buttons or a mini-joystick . The company then launched the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection . an innovative service that allowed DS system players to play with other users through a wireless network . Ever since its rollout , the DS had been a huge success and by April 2008 , Nintendo had sold more than 70 million units worldwide.</p>
<p>Among the many DS game titles , the most popular was Nintendogs , particularly among female gamers . Players of Nintendogs could interact with their virtual pets through the DS&rsquo;s built-in microphone and &quot; touch them via the touch-screen . They could take these dogs for Brainage , which featured brain-training games that were basically puzzl popular game was walks . teach them tricks and enter them into competitions . Another popular game was Brainage , which featured brain-training games that were basically puzzles.</p>
<p>Following the success of the DS , Nintendo rolled out the DS Lite in 2006 . With its mature Game Boy and innovative DS systems . Nintendo remained the leader in the handheld console segment and continued to retain well over 90% of the handheld device market that it had captured since 1989.</p>
<p>However , the deciding factor for Nintendo&rsquo;s success was the video game console segment Since 2000 , Nintendo had lost control of the fixed console market to Sonys PS . With its new strategy to capture non-gamers and expand the market , coupled with the lessons learnt from the DS handheld device , Nintendo developed its new console , the Wii , which arrived about the same time as the rollout of Microsofts Xbox 360 and Sony&rsquo;s PS3 , and just in time for the 2006 holiday shopping season.</p>
<p>The Wii was an impressive , well-designed and tiny machine controlled with a wand-like controller that resembled a TV remote control . Without an elaborate joypad and wire , gamers could navigate the system simply by moving the controller . Motion detectors would then translate the movement of the wand into on-screen action , enabling simultaion of real-life games such as tennis , bowling and even boxing . The games were sold on optical discs similar to DVDs . The Wii could also be connected to the internet for online news and weather updates and to access Nintendo&rsquo;s classic game catalogue ( eg , the Super Mario series ) , which could be downloaded from the web . To do this . players could access the Virtual Console service , whereby games originally released for the SNES and N64 could be downloaded from the Wii Shop Channel and accessed from the Wii.</p>
<p>Nintendo positioned the Wii as &quot; a machine that puts smiles on surrounding peoples faces encouraging communication among family members as each of them found something personally relevant and were motivated to turn on the console every day in order to enjoy &quot; the new life with Wii&quot;.  To promote the Wii . Nintendo adopted the same word-of-mouth strategy that had proved successful in promoting the DS . The company &quot; recruited a handful of carefully chosen suburban housewives to spread the word among their friends that the Wii was a gaming console the whole family could enjoy together &quot; . The Wii was also featured in the gamers self made video , which was then shared through YouTube and social networking sites . This once experimental approach had proven to be more effective than the traditiona advertising or mass-media campaigns used by Sony and Microsoft.</p>
<p>In addition to becoming the home gaming system for the family , Wii also helped expand exergaming , which was the combination of on-screen action with physical exercise . The origins of exergaming could be traced back to 1989 , when Nintendo released the Power Pad and Power Glove , two accessories for its gaming console . The Power Pad was a &quot; large plastic platform that plugged into the console and contained pressure sensors on which gamers could step or jump to play sports games &ldquo;. The Power Glove was a &quot; glove-like controller that translated various gestures into on-screen movements &quot; . However these two accessories had not sold well . Now , with the introduction of the Wii into millions of households , boxing tenniS , bowling , golf and baseball games would require players to act out the physical movements involved in these sports . Consequently , it was predicted that the Wii would spawn a whole new generation of exergaming that would go far beyond the existing games that used dance mats or video cameras to detect players actions , as the Wiis controller could detect more subtle movements and could be used to record and analyse these movements through intelligent software to determine the players physical fitness levels.</p>
<p>The Wii proved to be a runaway success and , by September 2007 , Nintendo became Japans most valuable listed company after Toyota , having zipped past US $ 72 billion in market value and almost tripling in value since the launch of the Wii the previous year.</p>

<ul>
<li>Video Game Hardware
<ul>
<li>Other than Nintendo , the video game hardware industry ( essentially comprising the manufacture of consoles and devices) was dominated by Sony with its PS family and Microsoft with the Xbox 360.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Video Game Software
<ul>
<li>The computer game industry , one of the biggest money-spinners in the global entertainment industry , routinely spent amounts ranging from USS12 million to USS20 millions in developing each game . As the consoles became more expensive , the cost of developing games for them also increased However . Nintendo turned its lower-cost hardware into another competitive advantage . By focusing on characters rather than special effects , developing Wii games cost the company about half what its competition was expending on Xbox and PS games , and thus the expense could be recouped at much lower volumes of sales . Nintendo had also thrown in five simple but highly addictive games , Wii Sports , with each console so that the buyer was getting a complete product at a great price . Sony and Microsoft , on the othe hand , incurred losses on the consoles they sold , despite their high price tags . To compensate for these losses , they sold their games with high licensing royalties . As of July 2008 , six of the 10 most popular games worldwide were for Nintendo consoles.</li>
<li>Nintendo also focused on developing first-party titles . Nintendo had placed its top software designers at the helm of hardware design . Thus , while Sony and Microsoft relied heavily on third parties to develop titles , Nintendo&rsquo;s consoles were designed to suit the concepts of the games that would run on them , allowing the creation of early first-party titles that really would have been impossible on another company &rsquo;s hardware y Yhes like Brainage . Such games would have been impossible on another companys hardware.</li>
<li>The sales of hardware consoles , such as Wii , Xbox and PS , were seen to be highly correlated to the launch and sale of the video games that could be played on them . For instance , in March 2008 , Nintendo launched its exclusive hit game Super Smash Bros Brawl for the Wii video game consoles in the US than Sony and Microsoft combined . the company sold more and , in that month , along with selling 2.7 million copies of the game , the company sold more video game consoles in the US than Sony and Microsoft combined.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-battle-had-begun">The Battle Had Begun</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was becoming clear that , in this latest battle between the Xbox 360 , PS3 and Wii , the Wi was the clear winner of the game</li>
<li>Exhibit 10-12</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="nintendos-disruptive-strategy">Nintendo&rsquo;s Disruptive Strategy</h3>
<ul>
<li>It was not just the video game industry that had felt the impact of the innovative Wii . With the December 2007 release of Wii Fit ( an extension of the Wii for exercise activities utilising the Wii Balance Board peripheral ) , the potential for capturing yet another class of non-gamers was significantly increased . Wii Fit aimed to integrate health and entertainment and featured approximately 40 different activities , including yoga , push-ups and other exercises . It was described as a way to help get families to exercise together . Within six months of being released , the product had sold two million copies in Japan and had long queues waiting for its delivery in many parts of the world . Its impact on the health industry was already evident in these few months , with doctors and therapists recommending it for various purposes , such as body balance , strength training , keeping patients interested in performing repetitive and tedious exercises , and for the elderly to enjoy expanding their range of motion.</li>
<li>Nintendo&rsquo;s business model was also exciting for small , independent software producers . In a strategic move in May 2008. Nintendo loosened its traditional tight control over content and WiiWare , an online channel for distributing downloadable games , was launched in the US and Europe . With WiiWare , users could download new games by independent developers.</li>
<li>While it was still too early to predict which way the competitors were headed , it seemed that Nintendo&rsquo;s Wi had revolutionised and changed the name of the game , and interestingly , not just in the video-game industry alone . Would this disruptive transformation of the video game industry leave the competitors in the cold ? What course of action was available to them ?</li>
