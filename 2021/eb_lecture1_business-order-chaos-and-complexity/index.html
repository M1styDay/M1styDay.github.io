<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>
<p>Chapter 1 Change and transformation in business explores past attempts at organisational transformation and considers why many of these efforts have been unsuccessful. Particular attention is given to the hope placed in the Total Quality Management (TQM) and Business Process Reengineering (BPR) movements as an elixir for organisational problems. We then introduce the concepts of chaos and complexity as effective ways to study organisations in terms of relationships, rather than the mere sum of their tangi-ble parts. We argue that the impact of information technology must be viewed within the context of its interaction with the other four major organisational components: strategy, processes, structure, and people.</p>

<ul>
<li>Because e-business initiatives usually have multiple objectives, we should first understand why companies invest in information technology (IT). Lederer and associates (2001) divide the management objectives for IT investments into three groups: transactional benefits, informational benefits, and strategic benefits:
<ul>
<li>Companies make transactional IT investment with the objective of automating their financial events such as payroll. The focus is on reducing costs and labour, and improving organizational efficiency and communications, in terms of both speed and quality of the information produced.</li>
<li>Informational IT investments are undertaken to improve management and operational control of the firm. The focus is on improving information quality, access, and flexibility.</li>
<li>Companies also make strategic IT investments with a view to gaining competitive advantage. Investments in this type of systems are made with the objective of attaining certain strategic goals such as enhancing competitiveness, responding to environmental changes or improving customer relations. We will further elaborate on these strategic objectives in the next chapter.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-causes-transformation-initiatives-to-fail">What causes transformation initiatives to fail</h3>
<ul>
<li>Total qulity management
<ul>
<li>The concept of TQM swept corporate America in the early 1980s before spread-ing to the rest of the world. While some firms launching TQM initiatives saw modest improvements in key performance indicators, it has been estimated that as much as 80 per cent have been disappointed with their results. Below is a list of the major reasons why TQM did not work:
<ul>
<li>Top management’s failure to change: The success of TQM depends on a paradigm shift in management thinking; TQM works only if senior manage-ment develops a deep and comprehensive understanding of the initiative.</li>
<li>Rigid corporate culture: For TQM to work, it requires a participatory management style. However, many companies are bound by hierarchical, command-and-control structures and are unable to empower employees. This in turn hampers the free flow of information between management and employees.</li>
<li>Fear and distrust: In the absence of clear communication, employees often grow suspicious of change initiatives. They grow concerned about the impact of the change on their jobs, develop anxiety over job security and thus exhibit resistance to change.</li>
<li>Limited focus: Many TQM initiatives have focused on certain processes without studying the holistic impact of changes brought about to the entire organization.</li>
<li>Credibility of implementation: Because of an incomplete focus, employees may not understand the rationale behind the transformation process, how it works, how they can participate, and what is in it for them.</li>
<li>Lack of strategic fit: Many TQM initiatives did not succeed because they were not integrally linked to the organization’s basic strategic processes, particularly the key customer processes.</li>
<li>Inadequate management process: Management processes are required to measure the progress of the transformation initiative. Beginning with top management, each executive should be accountable for monitoring the progress of change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Business process reengineering
<ul>
<li>In the early 1990s, BPR emerged as the latest elixir to invigorate an underper-forming business.8 The basic idea was to link IT with processes that cut across functional boundaries. Michael Hammer and John Champy defined the term as “. . . the fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic results improvements in contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service and speed.” The concept came with much appeal as it promised business transformation from the ground level and in a short time-frame – something that other change efforts such as TQM failed to deliver.</li>
<li>By the mid-1990s, over 70 per cent North American and European companies were engaged in some form of reengineering, creating a $51 billion business.10 By the late 1990s, however, with inconclusive evidence about the effectiveness of BPR, its allure started to fade. Even its primary champions conceded that 70 per cent of all reengineering projects failed.11 BPR had become associated with downsizing, leading to employees’ demoralization and other dysfunctional behaviour. Indeed, a late 1990s survey of companies found that efforts to reengi-neer solely on cost-cutting grounds severely undercut morale without any com-pensating benefit in the long term.</li>
<li>Why did such a promising transformation approach lead to such lacklustre results? Major reasons include:
<ul>
<li>Cost-driven: During the economic recession of the 1980s, firms were keen to find ways to restructure their businesses. With the emergence of BPR, corporate executives seized the opportunity to deal with redundancy problems. Cost-cutting and lay-offs were packaged under the lofty banner of reengineer-ing; instead of the overhaul of basic processes, immediate and tangible cost reduction became the goal. These short-term measures in turn led not only to the rapid loss of human capital and employee loyalty, but also to organizational “memory”. Companies were unable to replace the knowledge, know-how, skills, and experiences that had resided in the laid-off individuals.</li>
<li>Myth of the clean slate: To senior management who had become frustrated with incremental improvements, the notion of a “clean-slate” approach to reengineering had particular appeal. Under this approach, design teams attempted to build best practices into all processes, without regard to constraints of existing information systems or other organizational factors. This clean-slate approach is rarely found in practice, however, because few firms can afford to “obliterate” their existing business environments and start from scratch,13 something espoused by the original iteration of the BPR doctrine.</li>
<li>Insufficient breadth: In contrast to the clean-slate myth, many reengineering projects did not succeed because of insufficient process breadth. Corporate issues are often defined in very narrow functional terms such as sales problem or human resources conflict. This type of functional view prevents companies from fully understanding the cross-functional, inter-organizational nature of processes. Discarding, or paying lip service to intrinsic interdependence, resulted in incremental, patched solutions. Successful process requires that all dimensions of the solution space have been properly aligned to deliver some strategic value.</li>
<li>Unclear or non-existent performance measures: Based on a McKinsey Consulting study of BPR projects, most companies did not achieve measurable performance impacts.14 Paradoxically, many managers involved in these change projects never learnt that their reengineering efforts did not have measurable impacts. They analyzed improvements relative to the process being redesigned, rather than the organization as a whole.</li>
<li>Technology as the solution: IT-driven transformation, when viewed as the solution to fix an organizational problem, can ultimately lead to disappointing results. Process designers, usually led by IT specialists, identify new technologies and, based on their understanding of the properties and capabilities of the new technologies, formulate solutions and designed improvements to existing business problems. This type of “engineering” view of the firm can be restrictive because it focuses on problem-solving as an end in itself. In Chapter 2 we show that for transformations to be successful, com-panies need to take an “architectural” view of business by focusing on rela-tionships within and between processes and other organizational dimensions. IT specialists often steer BPR change projects into proofs-of-concept for leading-edge technologies, assuming that the effective design and creation of enabling technology is a sufficient condition for successful implementa-tion of the business redesign. These IT-driven reengineering efforts usually tend to focus on incremental improvement in automating existing processes, undermining the “obliteration” concept behind the original BPR idea. Another drawback of this approach is the pre-conceived fixation on a technology-based solution. This occurs when management pre-selects a technology solution based on the successful implementation of that technology by a major competitor or a recommendation from a long-standing technology partner, without a methodological study of the involved business processes.</li>
<li>Lack of senior management support: As in any major change effort, objec-tions and disagreements that can only be solved through senior manage-ment intervention arise in reengineering projects. In addition, unless senior executives are personally involved in the design of new processes, they may be unwilling to authorize major expenditures to implement those designs. It is estimated that 30–50 per cent of a very senior executive’s time is necessary to achieve major change across broad, cross-functional processes.</li>
<li>Lack of empowerment: While senior management support is crucial, project success will ultimately depend on how quickly and effectively employees themselves embrace change. Half of the companies undertaking BPR efforts report that the most difficult aspect is dealing with fear and anxiety in their organizations.17 Transformations yield anticipated results only if employees are empowered to thoroughly understand the rationale behind the change, are part of the change, and have a sense of ownership of the transformation effort. It is only then that companies can keep employees accountable for results.</li>
<li>Excessive reliance on consultants: Given the scale and complexity of reengi-neering projects, it is rare that companies can carry out the implementation internally. Most reengineering projects involve outside consultants who act as knowledge experts in the definition and execution of the BPR project. The value of the consultants lies in their capability to introduce best practices from other projects, and to influence the strategic thinking of the organization. Being brought in from the outside, however, consultants cannot be expected to have in-depth understanding of the structural and human capitals that are embedded in the organization. Because non-codified organizational knowledge is not amenable to direct management consultant influence, it tends to be neglected in the analysis and implementation processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Summary
<ul>
<li>In sum, successful organizational transformation requires a holistic approach that focuses on the dynamic interplay between the actors, the context, and the technology.The following is an abbreviated list of the major pitfalls in transformation efforts:
<ul>
<li>studying processes in isolation</li>
<li>treating technology as a panacea</li>
<li>insufficient management involvement throughout the change effort</li>
<li>neglecting the organization’s cultural legacy</li>
<li>inappropriate or unclear performance measures</li>
<li>lack of integration with the organization’s basic strategic processes.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The proliferation of advanced information and communication technologies, the accelerated rate of globalization in business, and the increased interdependence among organizations present both challenges and opportunities to businesses. In response, companies are keenly aware that they should change in order to survive, but recognize that it is not easy to bring transformation efforts to fruition. The statistics reflecting the huge failure of change efforts inform us that something is amiss: that we need more effective change strategies in order to achieve the desired outcomes from transformation initiatives; and that we need to gain a better under-standing of the complexities embedded in today’s rugged business landscape.</li>
<li>Things appear complex because we do not understand them. When we under-stand something, it no longer appears complex. An understanding of chaos and complexity theories will help us in our journey to understand the chaotic and complex environment that we live in.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="chaos-complexity-and-complex-adaptive-systems">Chaos, complexity and complex adaptive systems</h3>
<ul>
<li>Chaos theory
<ul>
<li>Chaos theory takes a holistic view of the world within which relationship is thekey. Nothing exists except in relation to everything else. In the chaotic world, order emerges through a web of relationships that constitute the whole. That is why in studying organizations we must focus on relationships, rather than analyzing merely the tangible parts. This focus is of fundamental significance in any initiative relating to organizational transformation; no single process is meaningful unless it is studied within the realm of relationships with other parts of the system.</li>
<li>We can observe the importance of relationship in all aspects of life, including the arts and sciences: “I don’t paint things, I paint only relationships between things,” said Henry Matisse, the famed impressionist. In the same vein, organizational designers, those responsible for devising the business architecture, should not treat individual processes as “things” that can be studied in isolation. Rather, the roles and impacts of individual processes should be examined in the realm of their dynamic fit in the whole system. As we just discussed, one of the main reasons TQM and BPR projects have not succeeded is because of a focus on individual processes rather than on the whole organization.</li>
<li>Chaos theory embodies many paradoxes observed in our daily lives. It allows us to better understand the disorder that underlies apparent order. It is about keeping individual identities within a web of relationships. As with all living organisms we try, on the one hand, to maintain a clear sense of individual iden-tity within a larger network of relationships that help shape our identity. On the other hand, our individual survival depends on how we learn to participate in a web of relationships. At the same time we produce ourselves, we change in order to preserve, we self-organize.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Complex adaptive systems
<ul>
<li>Organizations are open, non-linear systems that use feedback systems to co-evolve and survive. Like other complex adaptive systems, organizations share the fol-lowing common characteristics:
<ul>
<li>They are open systems that interact with their environment through the exchange of energy, material, and feedback (in the form of information).</li>
<li>Each organization forms a part of the environment for other organizations. This co-evolution is particularly true in today’s networked business environment where the action of a given company triggers action and reaction in other companies.</li>
<li>Contrary to popular belief, equilibrium is a precursor to organizational decline because organizations are less likely to respond to change when in a state of equilibrium.Companies need to have disequilibrium-generating devices to deter complacency. The case study following this chapter, Global Recycle Ltd: An e-Business Strategy, deals with a young Scottish entrepreneur’s efforts to develop an online exchange and take the age-old business of scrap dealing to a new dimension by changing established modes of business practice. Later on we see how companies can use diversity and variety as a means of reinvigorating their systems. We also discuss how inertia, the subtle yet lingering drive for persevering equilibrium, can lead to the erosion of strategic advantage.</li>
<li>Organizations are non-linear. Simple cause-and-effect fails to explain organizational complexity. Chaos theory tells us a small change in a system’s initial condition can have a vast effect on the final outcome of the system. As such, a small misstep in the beginning of a business project or initiative may have a substantive impact on the final outcome of the project. For example, we have seen how a small misunderstanding in analyzing users’ requirements in a proposed system could drastically affect the usefulness of that system; an innocuous rumour can blow up into uncontrollable self-feeding frenzy; or an action by a small group could put the whole organization in jeopardy, as was in the Enron case.</li>
<li>Organizations use information as a feedback mechanism to see how well they are doing compared with their stated objectives. Sales reports of a newly launched product, for example, tell a company how well they are doing against their sales target. Feedback loops can be either balancing (negative) or amplifying (positive). Balancing feedback loops use infor-mation to prevent a system deviating from desired goals. The objective is to achieve stability by regulating and controlling various operations. For example, the information related to a project’s cost overrun is fed back into the system, prompting management to curtail costs. Like thermostats, managers use negative loops to evaluate performance against standards.In contrast, amplifying feedback loops use information to see if there is something new and amplify it to signal a need to change. In amplifying loops, information increases and disturbances grow, prompting change to avoid system deterioration. In effect, disequilibrium is used to the system’s advantage, it is used as a vehicle for growth. By employing an amplifying feedback loop, for example, companies can reward individual creativity, thus fostering organizational innovations.The implications of a feedback loop for e-business transformation should be obvious. They can be used for better organizational control and, at the same time, for faster market responsiveness.</li>
<li>GE’s senior executives routinely go through workouts – meetings during which employees rebuke top executives over unwanted bureaucracy and redundant work practices.24 This workout programme not only improves communication up and down the organizational echelons, but more importantly, it rids the company of outmoded and counter-productive habits.</li>
<li>Organizations have fractal structures, forms in which nested parts are shaped into the same pattern as the whole (self-similarity). In essence, self-similarity happens when the functional relationships among a system’s subsystems are similar to the relationships between the elements in each subsystem. Fractals show the partnering of chaos and order; they are the emergent patterns underlying the order in disorder. Try to get hold of a fern and examine it very closely. You would be amazed to find out that the whole structure of the leaf is based on repetition of a simple shape comprising only four straight lines. This pattern is repeated over and over, free to change in size but not shape, to create fern trees and forests.</li>
<li>Companies can increase organizational flexibility and agility by building self-similarity in their structures. Faced with a sudden threat or opportunity, companies with self-similar structures can change direction quickly because of their ability to assemble effective teams.Companies can achieve self-similarity usually by building culture, values, and processes that are self-similar. Emerson Electric embedded self-similar processes throughout its organization by successfully drilling the essential elements of management processes into every manager at the company.</li>

<h3 id="organizational-transformation">Organizational transformation</h3>
<ul>
<li>Organizational change is commonly divided into incremental and radical (evolu-tionary and revolutionary). Incremental change relates to a series of continuous progressions that affect only part of the organization, while radical change entails a frame-breaking burst that blows out the established organizational equilibrium.27</li>
<li>Transformation is more closely related to radical change because it usually affects the entire organization. However, transformation is not an on–off event because it does not necessarily happen through sudden bursts. Rather, transfor-mation is usually accompanied by a series of continuous progressions that involve putting in place fundamental technologies, creating new structures and processes, developing new products/services, or creating new markets. As dis-cussed above, transformation projects are bound to fail if they do not account for the dynamic tension between various organizational components, including employees affected by such organizational change.</li>
<li>So companies should initiate transformation projects not only for diagnostic reasons, trying to “fix” emerging dysfunctional processes, but more importantly as a means for self-renewal, growth, and development. The success of such ini-tiatives depends on the dynamic synchronization of the key organizational dimensions with the environment.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="transformation-process-phases">Transformation process phases</h4>
<ul>
<li>The transformation process can be divided into six broad phases:
<ul>
<li>Initiation: The organizational transformation process is initiated by the realization that something is needed, wanted and is possible beyond the ordinary. The “antennas” of self-organizing companies are instinctively up because continuous transformation is essential to the evolutionary process of self-renewal. They constantly scan their environment, examine market forces, and identify potential threats and opportunities. The crucial thing at this stage is establishing a sense of urgency. John Kotter, a Harvard professor, found that over 50 per cent of transformation projects falter at this stage because of senior management’s impatience or inability to create a sense of urgency.31 It is not usually easy to bring people out of their comfort zones and drum up support for a potentially destabilizing initiative.</li>
<li>Coalition: The next step relates to assembling a powerful coalition. In the absence of an initial critical mass of people with commitment, transformation projects fail even before they start. Initially, the size of coalition should be around three to five people based on the size of the company. However for large companies, the size of coalition needs to be expanded to the 20–50 range in order for the project to grow. In recent years because transformation efforts usually extend the organizational boundaries, coalitions have come to involve external parties. In Chapter 2 we will discuss the role of partnerships in e-business strategic formulation.</li>
<li>Formulation of a vision: The new ideas must be communicated and promoted widely and iteratively in order to heighten the organization’s awareness and understanding. Using the right “language” is very important in this phase. Many transformational initiatives get stuck here because of the inability of the initiators to articulate and share their ideas with the rest of the organization. Formulation of a vision can be possible only if the language used to describe the new phenomenon is integrated with the existing language and practice. It is the job of the guiding coalition to communicate the new vision by “walking the talk,” becoming an embodiment, a symbol of the transformation vision and culture. In the Green Pastures case, we will see that when senior managers fail to manage the interplay between employees and technology, the prospects of transformation efforts can become seriously jeopardized. Let us not forget that in the final analysis there would be no transformation unless hundreds or thousands of people who are being affected by the change are going to buy into the transformation initiative. Many obstacles, including inflexibility in structures or systems, and stonewalling by employees who are threatened by the transformation, should first be removed before the organization can proceed to the next step.</li>
<li>Experimentation: When an idea is attractive enough to require action, it enters this phase. Through experimentation, companies can test the viability of new ideas and theories. Innovativeness requires a culture that is amenable to continuous experimentation; companies that do not encourage experimentation are not usually innovative. But since excess experimentation may lead to the disruption of the core business, a viable strategy is tocultivate fringes around the company. The success of this type of strategy, however, depends on a company’s ability to promote the new ideas internally. Consider the case of the Xerox research and development lab, Palo Alto Research Centre (PARC), which invented many familiar technologies including the first personal computer (Alto), the mouse, Ethernet, laser printer, flat screen and so on. Xerox failed to reap the economic benefits of these innovations because of its inability to integrate the new inventions into its mainstream business.32 A company that may have been a technology powerhouse is now relegated to the bottom of product food chain, manufacturing commoditized products such as generic copiers. The company’s market valuation reflects this sorry state of affairs.</li>
<li>Integration and implementation: During this phase, new ideas are implemented and integrated into the mainstream organization. Successful integration, however, is possible only if the new way of doing things is anchored in and, at the same time, subsumes the old system. In this process, the daunting challenge is the deep understanding of the business architecture, mapping form to function by focusing on holistic relation-ships between processes rather than on individual processes.</li>
<li>Institutionalization: Transformation is a continuous process that requires constant fine-tuning and improvement; it is a never-ending process because self-renewal is an intrinsic attribute of complex systems such as organizations. After successful integration and implementation, companies need to imprint what they have learned in the transformation process into their “DNA” so that the new processes can begin to reinvent themselves.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="paradoxes-surrounding-organizational-transformation">Paradoxes surrounding organizational transformation</h4>
<ul>
<li>A paradox is a seemingly contradictory statement that may nonetheless be true. By posing a tension between two apparently contradictory statements, we induce creative thinking about how such contradictions can exist in reality.34 As complex systems, organizations need to grapple with numerous paradoxes that entail tradeoffs. Understanding and reconciling these paradoxes is a diffi-cult but necessary part of organizational transformation.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="diversity-vs-uniformity">Diversity vs uniformity</h4>
<ul>
<li>Companies need to strike a balance between uniformity and diversity. Whereas uniformity perpetuates a winning formula, diversity weakens that formula.</li>

<h4 id="organizational-legacy-vs-need-for-change">Organizational legacy vs need for change</h4>
<h3 id="a-framework-of-dot">A framework of DOT</h3>
<ul>
<li>In the remainder of this chapter we introduce the framework of DOT as a springboard to discuss how this book is organized. The framework (shown in Figure 1.2) is based on the premise that for companies to grow, they need to keep dynamic tension among the five major organization dimensions (strategy, structure, people, technology, processes) and five major external forces (cus-tomers, suppliers, partners, competitors, regulators). Because a change in any internal dimension or external force results in tension between that factor and all other factors, organizations need to put in place fluid, flexible, and agile net-worked organizational forms so that they can respond to market changes faster than rivals in order to gain a business advantage. Using this reconfigurable structure, companies can quickly combine skills and resources across the firm to respond to changes in the external environment.</li>
<li>Whereas firms could previously try to avoid complexity, today they have to learn to embrace and manage complexity. Traditional top-down structures are simply incapable of accounting for interdependence among organizations because they slow down the flow of information between and within organiza-tions. On a similar note, strategies ingrained in protected or stable markets are no longer adequate in today’s ever-changing global markets; companies need to adopt innovative approaches in their strategy. Whereas in times of relative stability, companies can reinforce their existing dominant organizational form by exploiting the existing markets and relationships, during periods of relative disorder and turbulence, firms need to develop new and enhanced capabilities for dealing with higher levels of complexity and disorder. Such exploration strategies include merger and acquisitions, increasing alliances, and increasing rate of research and development.</li>

<h3 id="organization-of-this-book">Organization of this book</h3>
<ul>
<li>Part 1: e-Business strategy and valuation relates to structure and strategy in the DOT framework. It consists of two chapters. In Chapter 2, “e-Business strategy,” we outline the forces transforming strategy, discuss how companies achieve sus-tainable competitive advantage, explain what forces erode competitive advantage, and outline the steps involved in e-business strategy. We argue that successful e-business transformation requires a holistic approach to help companies put together various components of e-business into a coherent system. More specifi-cally, we discuss how strategy acts as the guiding principle in setting in motion a firm’s journey in transforming its business processes around the Internet. Not only do we discuss the issues related to the external forces, we also examine the dynamic relationships between strategy and the other four internal dimensions in the DOT framework. In Chapter 3, “Valuing e-business investments and manag-ing performance,” we show that while limitations exist, e-business implementa-tions must be subjected to close scrutiny and accountability in terms of both their tangible and intangible benefits, and introduce various valuation methodologies and approaches for appraising e-business initiatives.</li>
<li>Part 2: e-Business infrastructure development relates to technology issues in the DOT framework. The purpose of this part is to introduce the subject of infra-structure and integration to a non-technical audience. We aim to cover the cru-cial trends and technologies that must be grasped by managers facing the question of e-business transformation. It consists of two chapters. Chapter 4, “e-Business infrastructure: the building blocks,” establishes the case for greater senior-management involvement in charting the course for enterprise infrastruc-ture. A brief overview of technological progress in organizational computing is presented, leading to the present e-business era. We then focus on the core build-ing blocks of e-business infrastructure as represented in an e-business compo-nents pyramid and introduce the key e-business applications and technologies relating to the essential relationships of the enterprise. Chapter 5, “e-Business infrastructure: integration, standards and security” establishes the importance of integration for achieving a successful e-business implementation. The facili-tating role of open XML-based standards is discussed, particularly with respect to the potential for such standards to supersede traditional Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) for Business-to-Business (B2B) transactions. An overview of security considerations and solutions is presented, and the issue of payment is examined. Finally, the trend towards wireless e-business is discussed.</li>
<li>Part 3: e-Business process management focuses on processes in the DOT frame-work. It is comprised of three chapters. In this part we highlight the interdepen-dence of internal and external processes and the challenges related to integration within and across the enterprise. In Chapter 6, “Enterprise resource planning systems,” we discuss the primary corporate-wide application and the architec-tural framework into which most other applications plug. Chapter 7, “e-CRM: evolution from traditional relationships,” discusses the ever-important topic of consumer relationship management (CRM). Specifically we identify CRM as a process, explain how businesses can benefit from CRM processes, and discuss how CRM can affect a company’s competitive position. Chapter 8, “Supply Chain Management,” examines supply chain management (SCM), its components, plan-ning and execution issues, and integration challenges.</li>
<li>Part 4: e-Business implementation and globalisation relates not only to the peo-ple dimension in the DOT framework, but more importantly centres on the change management and cross-border regulatory issues brought about by e-business transformation. In this part we try to put all the pieces together. In Chapter 9, “e-Business change management: effective implementation of e-business strategies,” we establish the importance of e-business change manage-ment, conceptualize e-business change management as the joint optimization of technology, processes, and people, and outline common e-business change strategies. Chapter 10, “Legal Considerations of Global e-Business,” relates to e-business regulatory environment. It examines the multi-jurisdictional issues surrounding global, cross-border transactions, such as taxation, intellectual property rights, and privacy.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>In this chapter we set the stage to argue that e-business transformation is a dynamic and holistic process. Faced with threats or galvanized by opportunities, companies can no longer afford the luxury of equilibrium and stability. Today, changes are sweeping every corner of the corporate world. No industry is pro-tected; no business process is sheltered. Change is indeed integral to doing busi-ness. In response to customers’ never-quenching predilection for speed and agility and faced with an ever-increasing flow of information within and without their bounds, today’s organizations have no choice but to embrace change: changes brought about by technology, changes in demography, changes in consumer pref-erences, changes in strategic landscape. Change is the order of the day.</li>
<li>In this fast-moving environment, the traditional view of organizations as deterministic systems that strive for stability and equilibrium is no longer valid. Nor are the concepts underlying such organizations: vertical hierarchies, rigid structures, inflexible divisions of labour, precise task descriptions and operating procedures. By bringing down the artificial boundaries between companies, the Internet has further rendered these concepts invalid. Today, every company is part of a business web within which increasing complexity can only be managed by embracing change. Indeed, change has become the lever that turns the growth engine.</li>
<li>e-Business transformation is yet another form of organizational change, albeit an important one. In this chapter we briefly discussed that the successful e-business transformation depends, among other things, on a company’s ability to:
<ul>
<li>ontinuously scan the environment to identify potential threats as well as emerging opportunities;</li>
<li>drum up wide organizational support by creating a critical mass of people committed to the transformation initiative;</li>
<li>set up the necessary infrastructure;</li>
<li>revamp the existing business processes;</li>
<li>manage the implementation process; and</li>
<li>provide valuation rationale for the initiative.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We conclude this chapter by examining how courier giant Federal Express Corporation (FedEx) successfully transformed into an e-business. Two cases follow this introductory chapter and both involve e-business-driven change within age-old industries. Green Pastures Agribusiness examines a company in the fertilizer industry that underwent its transformation effort while belea-guered by an outmoded closed-door management style. By contrast, in Global Recycle: An e-Business Strategy for the Recycling Industry, an innovative young entrepreneur develops an online trading platform that becomes an essential facilitator in deal-making for the recycling industry and eliminates the need for costly intermediaries.</li>

<li>In early 2000, FedEx announced a new branding strategy that involved chang-ing the Company’s name and extending the “FedEx” brand to three additional operating subsidiary companies. The intention was to take advantage of one of its greatest assets, the FedEx brand name; the name that customers count on for “absolutely, positively” reliable service and cutting-edge innovation. The renaming of the company as FedEx Corporation and the extension of the brand to its subsidiaries was in line with its intention to provide customers with an integrated set of business solutions. Customers would want to deal with one company to meet their transportation and logistics needs.</li>
<li>Apart from branding, there were also major reorganizations that resulted in a single point of access to sales, customer services, billing, and automation sys-tems. Previously, these services were performed separately by the five subsidiary companies. With these consolidations, the company announced the formation of another subsidiary, called FedEx Corporate Services. Knowledge generation and use is at the heart of this new subsidiary, which pools together the market-ing, sales, customer services, IT, and e-commerce resources of the Group.</li>
<li>Each operating subsidiary continues to operate independently, but collec-tively, to provide a wide range of business solutions. Independently, the sub-sidiaries can retain focus on meeting customers’ specific logistics needs. But it is this collective synergy of solutions, built on an integrated knowledge base that gives FedEx its distinct competitive advantage. The new organization aims to use its rich knowledge base as the major pillar of its brand equity to help businesses of all sizes to achieve their shipping, logistics, supply chain, and e-business objectives. This is made possible through its integrated information infrastructure.</li>
<li>The reorganization served to align the organizational structure with the information infrastructure and integrated inter-organizational processes that FedEx has established. In so doing, FedEx aimed to leverage its cross-company customer knowledge base and its IT infrastructure to create better e-business solutions for its customers. This has opened up the opportunity for knowledge integration between business units within the Group, and has allowed FedEx to exploit its brand equity as well as its customer equity. The bundling strategy has made FedEx more convenient and accessible to customers, such that regardless of the choice of FedEx services, customers benefit from an integrated information platform. Whether customers contact FedEx in person, by phone or over the Internet, they are routed to one “touch point” for all services. Front-line staff has access to all previous records about every customer, kept in the Company’s central databases. By gaining access to such information, staff is able to customize their service to each customer. They can also suggest inte-grated solutions for complete supply chain and e-commerce needs, and can cross-sell services and choreograph customer solutions. Customers can access up-to-the-minute information on package/consignment delivery status regard-less of the mode of transportation, the type of service chosen, or the geo-graphical location.</li>
<li>By bringing its organizational structure into line with its information infra-structure, FedEx is realizing the power of its brand equity. FedEx’s integrated knowledge base is also helping other businesses to bridge the physical world and the virtual world, thus improving their operational efficiency and potentially enhancing their strategic position.</li>

<h2 id="case-from-mental-models-to-transformation-overcoming-inhibitors-to-change">Case: From Mental Models to Transformation: Overcoming Inhibitors to Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduction
<ul>
<li>The global financial crisis of 2008</li>
<li>Wal-mart, Toyota, Apple, Google, Facebook, Craiglist and Li &amp; Fung</li>
<li>If an organization wants to achieve staying power through good times and bad . it can never allow itself to be static . It must constant - ly test and challenge its current mental models and experiment with new ones . In this article . we will examine some strategies for chal - lenging mental models and overcoming inhibitors to change.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Roots of Mental Models
<ul>
<li>Napster</li>
<li>Digital music</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Developing a Portfolio of Models
<ul>
<li>IBM</li>
<li>Apache</li>
<li>IBM used three strafues that are critical to the process of challening our mental models:
<ul>
<li>Assess current models</li>
<li>Generate new models
<ul>
<li><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/M1styDay/image_hosting/master/hugo_images/20210410103713.png" alt=""></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Develop a portfolio of models
<ul>
<li>Although IBM embraced its new model , it was still a for-profit company and did not abandon its proprietary models . Paradigm shifts that are seen as revolutions by early proponents are often not absolute : the rise of e-mail has not eliminated the elegant fountain pen or handwritten notes on fine paper ; and while Apple is a digital company its physical stores create a sense of excitement and a cus tomer experience that cannot be found online.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Overcoming Inhibitors to Change
<ul>
<li>Introducing new-and-improved models to the world entail two important steps
<ul>
<li>Changing the organization&rsquo;s infrastructure
<ul>
<li>eBay and Craigslist fundamentally changed the model for seling used products</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Bridging adaptive disconnects
<ul>
<li>Procter &amp; Gamble transformed its new product development by tapping into external inventor networks for innovations such as its SpinBrush and whitening strips.</li>
<li>Some companies are now drawing together R &amp; D , marketing and operations in new product development , or marketing and finance are collaborating on improving marketing metrics By bridgi silos , organizations can fundamentally change the way they address critical problems.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Ensuring the Transformation Continues
<ul>
<li>Once current models have been assessed and new models have been identified and carried into the world , the challenge is to con - tinue to test mental models quickly and effectively . There are two basic approaches to the requisite decision process : an analytical formal process and an intuitive process.</li>
<li>To keep your mental models fresh and relevant , we suggest the blowing strategies
<ul>
<li>Develop and Apply Intuition</li>
<li>Experiment Continuously</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In closing
<ul>
<li>How is flat-world thinking limiting your own possibilities? What new threats and opportunities can you uncover with a shift in thinking? <strong>Mental models are not just an abstract concept. Millions of dollars will be won or lost based on the mindset of the person making the investments.</strong> Companies with staying power will have the capability to challenge and , when necessary, change their mental models to embrace new worlds.</li>
