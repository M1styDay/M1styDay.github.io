<h3 id="overview-of-the-week">Overview of the Week</h3>
<p>Topic: This is a game simulation review session and preparation for the final executive board presentation and report.</p>
<p>We have covered a strategy toolkit and learned to apply industry analysis—five forces, competitive advantage, value chain, industry life stages and evolution, and finally, blue ocean or value innovation strategy. As a helpful self review, you can fill out the table attached at the end of this outline.(class 3/class 5)</p>
<p>Simulation Game Discussion—We’ll review the key learning goals of the simulation game, note the decisions and takeaways from Q1-Q4 and see how well you can analyze a sample game with the competitive analysis skills you’ve developed. We will discuss the plusses and minuses of the Strategy Simulation Game as you’ve experienced them. I will provide my perspective on how it compares to real-life start-up environments from my experience over the years as board director, corporate venture capitalist or advisory board member of more than fifty tech startups in Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>Executive Board Presentation&ndash;Finally, we will provide some guidelines for your Final Executive Board Presentation. In the final class session, you’ll experience presenting and discussing your company’s competitive and market performance highlights and lowlights to your primary investor and executive board of director’s chairperson—myself—as well as getting an inside perspective on the teams that you competed with in your Virtual World. In the handout, I have provided a grading rubric for showing the criteria used to evaluate the different sections of the report and presentation.</p>

<h3 id="couese-approach">Couese Approach</h3>
<p>We will take the following approach to practice our entrepreneurial strategic thinking skills as we go through the game simulation in this course:</p>
<ol>
<li>KNOW how and when to use the firm-level and industry-level analytical tools and frameworks.</li>
<li>THINK and be comfortable with the strategy frameworks in action, by seeing the step-by step process of applying strategy analysis to a range of real-life company and industry cases. You’ll be surprised to find that once you have a strategic framework or conceptual “lens”, that you will develop a more intuitive point-of-view on companies and industries you find interesting and worth following in the business press.</li>
<li>SPEAK and share your strategic thinking, analysis, relevant experience and insights in our discussion-based online forums, synchronous sessions and in influencing your Simulation Game team decision-making.</li>
<li>ACT and practice applying competitive advantage, value chain, industry stages of evolution and blue ocean value innovation to new company and industry cases, as well to your simulation game executive decision-making.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a framework, consider keeping a comparison chart like the following to remind you about the (a) companies and (b)industries covered, (c) what you found most useful about the strategy tool, (d) what your takeaways were and (e) when you should use this tool.</p>
