<h3 id="wechat-vs-whatsapp">WeChat vs WhatsApp</h3>
<p>Both Tencents WeChat and Facebook&rsquo;s Whats App had green logos and began as chat apps but that was largely where their similarities ended . Whats App features remained limited to chat , voice calls and sending media . It also had an encryption upgrade that assured messages could not be intercepted by third parties , although Facebook still had access to the chat records and made wide use of them . Conversely , Tencent developed WeChat into a mobile platform rather than a simple product . The features it offered far exceeded users expectations of what they would get from a chat app . &quot; It was possible to hail a taxi , order food delivery , buy movie tickets play games , check in for flights , transfer money to friends , access fitness tracker data , book a doctors appointment , get a bank statement , pay the water bill , find geo-targeted coupons, recognize music , search for a book in the local library , meet strangers milling around in proximity , follow celebrity news , read magazine articles , donate to charity 33 or share moments as with the Facebook Timeline , among other features see Exhibit 5 ] . Unlike most Western apps , which served a single purpose , WeChat was a platform that offered a plethora of uses and featured literally millions of authorized apps that were granted access to WeChat APIs , and were added to users contact lists the same way that friends were added . The WeChat wallet directly connected to a credit card - allowed easy payments on the online platform and in the real world at shops , events , restaurants and other locations , usually with the use of a QR ( quick response &quot; code . WeChat started as a texting app and evolved to an e-commerce ecosystem in which social media was just a feature . On Facebook , one could learn about a Starbucks promotion ; on WeChat , the promotion could be followed by purchases processed directly through WeChat Wallet . Accordingly , some suggested Facebook should follow WeChat&rsquo;s strategic road map and move toward a platform-over-product strategy.</p>

<h3 id="from-copy-culture-to-accelerated-innovation">From Copy Culture to Accelerated Innovation</h3>
<h3 id="tencent-going-global">Tencent Going Global</h3>
<p>Tencent had been building a global empire on three levels : 1 ) content ( such as gaming , movies animation ) 2 ) chat , and 3 ) payments . It acquired or had stakes in global game companies and overseas chat platforms such as Kako ( South Korea ) , Snapchat ( U . S ) Hike ( India ) and KIK ( Canada ) , with whom it built partnerships . Unlike Facebook ( which had a presence everywhere but in China , North Korea and Iran ) , Tencent was in China and expanded internationall through alliances . l As of February 2016 , WeChat Pay International offered payments in ten currencies : RMB , AUR , CAD , EUR , GBP , HKD , JPY , KRW , NZD and USD . It encouraged overseas vendors not only to plug into the payment system to better serve Chinese tourists and overseas Chinese residents , but also to set up We Chat accounts and We Chat shops . For the Chinese , Tencent was the preferred payment option abroad , as they usually had imited coverage or no access at all to their Chinese credit cardS . Another incentive for the vendor came with the feature that turned a buyer into an instant follower , as &quot; follow was conveniently built into the &quot; buy button . s2 So far , there were no visible signs that Tencent intended to slow its global conquest . By contrast , Facebook still needed to break through the Great Firewall isolating China from the West . To be allowed into China , Facebook needed government approval , which required a censoring mechanism acceptable to Chinese authorities that would ensure Chinese users could not post , view or share materials deemed harmful to Chinese society.</p>
<h3 id="internet-isolationism-a-boon-to-creativity-and-the-economy">Internet Isolationism-A Boon to Creativity and the Economy</h3>
<p>Some suggested that the absence of Facebook , Google , YouTube and other major international online services was a catalyst for Chinese online business . Had it not been for the Great Firewall China would be stuck with Facebook China , Google China , YouTube China , Twitter China , and so on . Instead , they had B A T ( Baidu , Alibaba and Tencent ) , along with a number of local online businesses as well as millions of users and transactions. Blocking or hindering foreign competition not only allowed local companies to flourish , but also ensured that transactions and taxes on the services and goods provided stayed in China , which contributed to the local economy rather than sending profits offshore to American giants . Yet business matters were not the sole driver for setting up the Great Firewall of China . Monitoring and blocking sensitive content and preserving national security were parts of the agenda , which may have compromised freedom of speech , collaboration and education in exchange for safety and prosperity . In late November 2016 , the Chinese government strengthened internet security aws and required personal data collected in China to be kept in China . James Zimmerman , chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China , commented that it was a step backwards for innovation in China and would not do much to improve security.</p>
<h3 id="doing-internet-business-in-china">Doing Internet Business in China</h3>
<h3 id="plans-for-the-future">Plans for the Future</h3>
<p>In 2016 , Facebook was merely warming up . It had solid expansion plans that included video conquering LinkedIn and competing with Google search ( Facebook had 2 billion searches vs Google with 3 . 5 billion ) . Aspiring to connect the whole world , Facebook was also expanding its technology to reach areas with limited or no internet connection-a mission that was separately run as Internet . org . With Oculus , VR and AR technology , Facebook was well on the way to connect and then immerse the world within itself . 66 Leveraging user-generated content ,Facebook continued to monetize on advertising , empowered by machine learning ( which was capable of processing data not only from text , but from photos and videos , thanks to the new image-recognition engines ).</p>
<p>Tencent remained confident with its content chat and payments income streams . but also started expanding its interests into other industries . It set up Future Mobility to develop and manufacture self-driving cars . This was a partnership with Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd ( Foxconn ) and China Harmony New Energy Auto Holding Ltd . In the process , Tencent acquired many electric or self-driving car specialists from Alphabet , Daimler , Tesla Motors BMW AG and Nissan Motors . 7 In the online domain , credit-ratings technology and VR were the main future focus . Meanwhile . loT and smart devices were to be beta-tested in the ne US $ 599 million headquarters in Shenzhen , where the devices would communicate with people through WeChat and learn employee habits , likes and routines . The eco design , with features such as servers heating the swimming pool , would save Rmb 6.85 million ( around USS 1 million ) a year . The new headquarters would be ready by June 2017.</p>
<p>Connecting People became a famous advertising slogan displayed on Nokia phones for years . Similarly , Zuckerbergs plan was to &quot; help everyone connect in new ways , which sounded familiar . Was this a good strategy for Facebook to follow ? In March 2016 , in his last speech , Nokias CEO said &quot; We didnt do anything wrong , but somehow we lost . 69 So it was with companies that played the game of pushing platforms with network effects , where the winner took all . In contrast to Nokia , Tencent went a step further . With their connection strategy , it did not want to connect only people . It wanted to connect everyone and everything.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Mark Zuckerberg knew what he wanted and how he wanted it , but there were a few challenges that threatened Facebooks status quo . Its core revenues were still reliant on advertising , user base growth , user loyalty and engagement . Moreover , advertising , its main revenue channel clashed with privacy issues of which users were becoming more conscious and sensitive . This posed the threat that users would limit their engagement with the platform . Ultimately, Facebook had not come up with anything new for a while . Facebook Wallet failed , its Internet .org initiative struggled , e-commerce and e-payments had not caught up yet , and VR was merely a prototype. Was Facebooks business model sustainable ? Was it able to keep up with the accelerated pace of innovation imposed by its Chinese counterpart ?</p>
<p>The two companies started off as social media entities and then enhanced their business models Tencent built its empire by relying on the gaming industry , whereas Facebook focused on advertising revenues . Despite their initial similarity , they had arrived at a moment where the resemblance ceased to exist and their business models diverted . Tencent was diversifying its revenue streams and Facebook seemed focused on advertising profits . With cultural geopolitical and regulatory challenges , what could each of the two companies do to win the business-model race ?</p>
